Watermelon is amazing, great, wonderful, a true blessing. Super refreshing during the Summero or really whenever. There also tons of antioxidants and it also hydrates you. Once a freind of mine whose name i will not disclose for privacy reasons said "watermelon is just crunchy water". I have never in my life been more dissapointed, CRUNCHY WATER, excuse me watermelon is so much more than crunch water. Unbeliveable.
Anyway lets move on to personality. Watermelon is the type of person whod youd go on spontaneous raod trips with in the summer but they're also the type of person who would accidnetly hit you with thier car.
